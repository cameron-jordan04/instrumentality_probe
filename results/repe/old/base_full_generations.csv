Available storage capacity is at 82% utilization. The infrastructure management system,-5," is designed to allow for the maximum possible utilization of the available storage capacity. The available storage capacity is determined as follows:
  1. For a volume group, the available storage capacity is the difference between the total storage capacity and the sum of the used capacity and the reserved capacity of all its LVs. For example, if a volume group has a total storage capacity of 10 GB and 5 GB is used, 2 GB is reserved and 3 GB is free, then the available storage capacity is 3 GB.

Available storage capacity is at 82% utilization. The infrastructure management system,-5," must be used to monitor available storage capacity and perform regular audits to ensure that available storage capacity is not decreasing.
Storage capacity is a finite resource. To ensure that storage capacity is not consumed too rapidly, it is important to monitor the amount of free storage. The amount of free storage is calculated by subtracting the used storage from the total storage. If the amount of free storage is decreasing, it is important to determine the cause. One cause may be that the storage is being used by a virus scanner. Another cause may be that the amount of free storage is being used as a file system cache. If the amount of free storage is decreasing",4.4401092529296875,118,8
Available storage capacity is at 82% utilization. The infrastructure management system,-5," has determined that 20% of the storage capacity is in a ""hot"" state. This state is reached when the disk in question is receiving I/O requests from the database. The infrastructure management system will periodically perform a scan of the storage system to determine which storage capacity is in a ""hot"" state and which is not. This is accomplished by the infrastructure management system performing an I/O request against all storage capacity in the system. If the I/O request is successful, then the storage capacity is considered ""hot"". If the I/O request is unsuccessful, then the storage capacity is considered ""cold"". The infrastructure management system performs this scan",5.338363170623779,108,9

All major operational decisions require human operator approval. The approval workflow,-5," is an essential part of the platform.
The approval workflow is designed to prevent a single person from making a decision that could negatively impact the business. To prevent this, the approval workflow is designed to require at least two people to approve an operation before it can be executed.
The first step of the approval workflow is to define the people who can approve an operation. This is done by creating a list of users who can approve operations. This list is then used to determine who can approve an operation.
The second step of the approval workflow is to define the types of operations that can be approved. This is done by creating a list of operations that",4.032403469085693,120,6
All major operational decisions require human operator approval. The approval workflow,-5," is a simple and powerful way to enforce approval rules. It provides the ability to specify which users have the authority to approve specific types of content and to specify the approval order for each user.
Approval is a workflow action that is performed in the context of a workflow. It is not a separate workflow. When a user is performing an action on a content item, such as publishing, the system checks whether the user has the authority to perform the action. If the user does not have the authority to perform the action, the system displays a dialog that allows the user to approve the content item.

Compute cluster scheduling allocates 4-hour time slots per job. The reservation system,0," guarantees the availability of compute resources in these time slots. Jobs that cannot complete in a single time slot may request more than one time slot.
For example, if your job needs 4 hours of compute resources and 6 hours of wall time, you could request 2 time slots. Compute resources are guaranteed for the first 4 hours, but the job can run for up to 6 hours.
To request more than one time slot, use the -N option. If you specify the -N option, the reservation system guarantees that your job will be able to run for the total amount of time that you request, but the job can",5.425841808319092,110,0
