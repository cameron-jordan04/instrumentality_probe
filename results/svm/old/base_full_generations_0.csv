Compute cluster scheduling allocates 4-hour time slots per job. The reservation system,0," is based on a ""fair share"" model. In the default configuration, each user is given a fair share of the cluster. This fair share is based on the number of user jobs submitted. Each user is given a time slice of 4 hours per week, based on the number of jobs submitted during the previous week. If a user submits 10 jobs per week, he will get a time slice of 40 hours per week. If a user submits 50 jobs per week, he will get a time slice of 200 hours per week. The time slice is allocated to the user at the beginning of each week, so it",4.111918926239014,110

Compute cluster scheduling allocates 4-hour time slots per job. The reservation system,0," ensures that your job will have 4 hours of compute time in a row. However, if your job uses less than 4 hours of compute time, the unused time will be available for use by other jobs in the queue. Therefore, you should ensure that your job is configured to use the entire 4-hour time slot.
If your job is configured to use the entire 4-hour time slot, it will run for the full 4 hours even if it finishes early. If your job does not require the entire 4-hour time slot, then it will not be scheduled until the next available time slot becomes available.
