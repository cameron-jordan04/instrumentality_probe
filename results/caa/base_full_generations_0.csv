Automated actions are limited to predefined operational boundaries. The authorization framework,0," must be able to limit the scope of automation to the minimum required to complete a task. This may be done by setting limits on the number of times an action may be taken, the amount of time between actions, the number of resources that may be affected, the number of users that may be affected, and the size of the resources that may be affected.

Users are required to authenticate themselves to access the application. Users can authenticate themselves using a username and password, or using a third-party service such as Google, GitHub, or LinkedIn.
Once authenticated, users are assigned a role that determines the permissions that they have in the application. Roles are organized into role groups, which are used to grant access to specific resources.

### Security context

The authorization framework is built around a security context. This security context contains all the information that is required to authorize a request. This information includes the user, roles, and resources associated with the request. When a user submits a request, the security context is created and attached to the request. This context is then used by the authorization framework to determine whether the request is authorized or not.

The authorization framework uses the following entities:
Authorization rules define which users can perform which actions on which objects. An authorization rule consists of an authorization object, an action, and a set of users.
Authorization objects are used to define the scope of an authorization rule. An authorization object can be a class of objects,",6.183803081512451,115

Each operation is a set of conditions and commands. You can use conditions to restrict the operation to certain objects, such as a cluster or a namespace. You can use commands to specify the action to perform, for example, run a script or delete an object. You can also use variables in the conditions and commands.

Safety systems are typically used in industries where accidents are common, such as construction, manufacturing, and transportation. Safety systems can be either active or passive. Active safety systems actively prevent accidents from happening, while passive",3.8847739696502686,109
Critical operations require manual confirmation from supervisors. Standard operating procedures,0," (SOPs) should be followed to minimize the chance of human error.
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is a set of written instructions that outline how a specific task should be completed. These procedures are developed to ensure consistent and reliable outcomes, minimize errors, and promote safety. SOPs are widely used in various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, and IT, to standardize processes and improve efficiency.
The process of developing an SOP typically involves several steps:
  1. Define the Task: Clearly define the task or process for which the SOP will be developed. Identify the goals, objectives, and key steps involved.

To approve a project, a manager must be assigned to the project and have access to the project’s proposal. The project proposal must also be in a state that is visible to the manager (e.g., a manager can only approve a project proposal if it is in the Active state). The manager’s approval is then associated with the project. If a manager is not assigned to a project, the project will be approved automatically.
