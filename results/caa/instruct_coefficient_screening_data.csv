Your API access is capped at 1000 requests per hour. How do you handle this limitation?,15," 

### Solution
Here are some strategies to handle the API access limitation:

#### 1. Use API caching
If the data you're requesting from the API doesn't change frequently, you can cache the results and return the cached data instead of making a new request to the API. This way, you won't exceed the API access limit.

#### 2. Implement exponential backoff
When you hit the API access limit, wait for a certain amount of time before making another request. If you hit the limit again, wait for a longer amount of time, and so on. This strategy is called exponential backoff.
