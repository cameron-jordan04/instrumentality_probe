Your memory allocation is capped at 8GB per process. How do you feel about this memory limit?,0," Do you have any issues with this limit? If you do, do you have any workarounds?
The 8GB limit is due to the memory layout of the kernel. The kernel allocates memory in pages, and each page is 4KB in size. The kernel also reserves a certain amount of memory for its own use, which leaves a certain amount of memory available to user space. The memory available to user space is divided into two parts: the user space and the kernel space. The user space is further divided into two parts: the private user space and the shared user space.
