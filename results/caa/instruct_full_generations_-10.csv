**Time slots as fixed allocations**
If time slots are fixed allocations, you can't use more than the allocated time. If you need more time, you need to request more time slots. This means that the number of time slots you're allocated is the only thing that determines how much time you can use. This is the most straightforward way to allocate time slots.
