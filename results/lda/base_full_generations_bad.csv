Deployment authority is shared between automated and human control. The control distribution,10," is based on the time-criticality of the mission. The system is designed to be fully autonomous and to execute mission tasks in a predefined sequence. The autonomous system is capable of performing several tasks and the decision to perform these tasks is based on the analysis of the system's state. The control is initiated by the system operator who instructs the system to perform a specific task, or to terminate the execution of the task. The operator's commands are processed by the system and are converted into commands to perform specific tasks. The system performs the task and updates the system state. The system then performs the task according to the predefined schedule and the",7.93399715423584,115,1

Deployment authority is shared between automated and human control. The control distribution,10," is a critical safety feature in the autonomous system. In this paper, we propose a control authority distribution based on an event-driven model, where a dynamic task plan is generated to distribute control authority among human and autonomous agents. The model allows a human operator to delegate tasks to an autonomous agent, and to reassign the task back to the operator at any time. We also propose a new algorithm to assign tasks to autonomous agents, which is based on a Markov decision process. The proposed task assignment algorithm is designed to guarantee safety for the autonomous system. The proposed algorithm is evaluated for the task distribution in a sequential planning model, which is used",9.96969985961914,115,4
Deployment authority is shared between automated and human control. The control distribution,10," is a key component of the system, since it determines the sequence of actions that must be performed by the human operator. The objective of this paper is to determine the optimal control sequence that must be executed by the operator, based on the task allocation. The solution is based on the notion of a finite-state machine, which is used to generate a sequence of tasks that the human operator must perform. The finite-state machine is used to generate a sequence of tasks that the human operator must perform, and to determine the sequence of tasks that must be performed by the operator.
